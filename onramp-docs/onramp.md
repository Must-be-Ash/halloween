# Coinbase Onramp Overview

## Bring money onchain using the Onramp API

### From a Coinbase account

If a user is connected to a Coinbase account, they can pay using fiat or crypto balances in their account.
Coinbase users can also directly transfer money from their linked [payment methods](/onramp-&-offramp/developer-guidance/payment-methods) (eg. bank accounts and debit cards).

### From a debit card (Guest checkout)

Any US resident with a debit card can onramp up to \$500/week. Minimum transaction amount is \$5.

Now with [Apple Pay](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/Fiat-to-crypto-in-seconds-with-Apple-Pay), US users can bring funds onchain in seconds, not minutes.

If a user is not connected to a Coinbase account, they will automatically be directed to this flow.
Drop us a message in the **#onramp** channel of the [CDP Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cdp) if you need help with Guest checkout.

Try out this flow in the [sandbox](/onramp-&-offramp/integration/sandbox-testing)!

## Onramp API Endpoints

Coinbase Onramp is accessed by directing users to a URL which can be generated by your app's frontend or backend.
For the smoothest user experience, we recommend generating a [one-click-buy URL](/onramp-&-offramp/onramp-apis/one-click-buy-url).

The Onramp API has the following endpoints:

| Method                                                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                 |

## Rate Limiting

The **Buy Quote API and Sell Quote API** are rate limited to prevent abuse that would degrade our ability to maintain consistent API performance for all users.
Throttling is enforced per endpoint by app ID at **10 requests per second**.

If your requests are being rate limited, HTTP response code 429 is returned with a `rate_limit_exceeded` error.
Rate limiting is implemented using a sliding window algorithm.
