# Welcome to Embedded Wallets

## Overview

With Embedded Wallets, your users can access the full power of onchain through familiar authentication methods like email and social logins (no seed phrases, browser extensions, or pop-ups required).

Built on Coinbase's [trusted infrastructure](/server-wallets/v2/introduction/security), they enable users to interact with blockchain applications without the complexity of traditional wallet management.

## How it works

Embedded Wallets are designed to be invisible to end-users while providing full onchain functionality:

1. **User authentication**: Users sign in with familiar methods like email OTP
2. **Invisible wallet creation**: A wallet is instantly created without seed phrases or pop-ups
3. **Seamless transactions**: Users can send, swap, stake, and interact with onchain apps while maintaining full control of their assets
4. **Developer control**: You maintain complete control over the UI/UX while users retain custody

## Use cases

* **Payment applications**: Enable instant peer-to-peer payments and merchant checkouts with built-in fiat on/off ramps
* **Gaming platforms**: Enable in-game purchases and NFT ownership without wallet friction
* **Social applications**: Let users tip, collect, and trade directly within your platform
* **Marketplaces**: Streamline checkout with built-in crypto payments and NFT trading
* **DeFi applications**: Provide access to lending, borrowing, and yield farming with simple UX

## Security and compliance

Embedded Wallets leverage CDP's advanced security infrastructure to provide true self-custody with enterprise-grade protection:

* **[Advanced security architecture](/server-wallets/v2/introduction/security)**: All cryptographic operations occur within secure, isolated environments that even Coinbase cannot access
* **[Wallet behavior governance](/server-wallets/v2/using-the-wallet-api/policies/overview)**: Define custom rules to govern transaction behavior and protect against unauthorized actions
* **Temporary Wallet Secrets**: Device-specific cryptographic keys are generated and stored locally on users' devices, never exposed to Coinbase
* **True self-custody**: Unlike traditional MPC solutions, our approach ensures faster operations while maintaining user control
* **Multi-device support**: Users can securely access their wallet from up to 5 different devices

This architecture combines the convenience of embedded wallets with the security guarantees of self-custodial solutions, ensuring your users maintain full control of their assets.
