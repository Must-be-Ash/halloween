# Overview

The Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) Frontend SDK allows developers to provide embedded wallets and other
onchain primitives to their end users in their frontend applications.

The CDP Frontend SDK consists of several Typescript packages:

1. [@coinbase/cdp-core](/sdks/cdp-sdks-v2/frontend/@coinbase/cdp-core) - Core business logic to access the embedded wallet APIs
2. [@coinbase/cdp-hooks](/sdks/cdp-sdks-v2/frontend/@coinbase/cdp-hooks) - React hooks for state management of end users with embedded wallets
3. [@coinbase/cdp-react](/sdks/cdp-sdks-v2/frontend/@coinbase/cdp-react/index) - Off-the-shelf UI components for embedded wallets
4. [@coinbase/cdp-wagmi](/sdks/cdp-sdks-v2/frontend/@coinbase/cdp-wagmi) - Embedded wallet connector for Wagmi
5. [@coinbase/create-cdp-app](/sdks/cdp-sdks-v2/frontend/@coinbase/create-cdp-app) - A CLI for creating a starter app using the packages above

Click on any of the packages above for further information on how to install and integrate the CDP Frontend SDK.

The CDP Frontend SDK is currently in **beta**, meaning the APIs may change in future versions. We are actively gathering feedback from developers who try out the SDK.
