        already_exists: >-
          This error occurs when trying to create a resource that already
          exists.


          **Steps to resolve:**

          1. Check if the resource exists before creation

          2. Use GET endpoints to verify resource state

          3. Use unique identifiers/names for resources
        bad_gateway: >-
          This error occurs when the CDP API is unable to connect to the backend
          service.


          **Steps to resolve:**

          1. Retry your request after a short delay

          2. If persistent, contact CDP support with:
             - The timestamp of the error
             - Request details
          3. Consider implementing retry logic with an exponential backoff


          **Note:** These errors are automatically logged and monitored by CDP.
        faucet_limit_exceeded: >-
          This error occurs when you've exceeded the faucet request limits.


          **Steps to resolve:**

          1. Wait for the time window to reset

          2. Use funds more efficiently in your testing


          For more information on faucet limits, please visit the [EVM Faucet
          endpoint](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/api-reference/v2/rest-api/faucets/request-funds-on-evm-test-networks)
          or the [Solana Faucet
          endpoint](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/api-reference/v2/rest-api/faucets/request-funds-on-solana-devnet).
        forbidden: >-
          This error occurs when you don't have permission to access the
          resource.


          **Steps to resolve:**

          1. Verify your permissions to access the resource

          2. Ensure that you are the owner of the requested resource
        idempotency_error: >-
          This error occurs when an idempotency key is reused with different
          parameters.


          **Steps to resolve:**

          1. Generate a new UUID v4 for each unique request

          2. Only reuse idempotency keys for exact request duplicates

          3. Track used keys within your application


          **Example idempotency key implementation:**

          ```typescript lines wrap

          import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';


          function createIdempotencyKey() {
            return uuidv4();
          }

          ```
        internal_server_error: >-
          This indicates an unexpected error that occurred on the CDP servers.


          **Important**: If you encounter this error, please note that your
          operation's status should be treated as unknown by your application,
          as it could have been a success within the CDP back-end.


          **Steps to resolve:**

          1. Retry your request after a short delay

          2. If persistent, contact CDP support with:
             - Your correlation ID
             - Timestamp of the error
             - Request details
          3. Consider implementing retry logic with an exponential backoff


          **Note:** These errors are automatically logged and monitored by CDP.
        invalid_request: >-
          This error occurs when the request is malformed or contains invalid
          data, including issues with the request body, query parameters, path
          parameters, or headers.


          **Steps to resolve:**

          1. Check all required fields and parameters are present

          2. Ensure request body (if applicable) follows the correct schema

          3. Verify all parameter formats match the API specification:
             - Query parameters
             - Path parameters
             - Request headers
          4. Validate any addresses, IDs, or other formatted strings meet
          requirements


          **Common validation issues:**

          - Missing required parameters

          - Invalid parameter types or formats

          - Malformed JSON in request body

          - Invalid enum values
        invalid_sql_query: |-
          This error occurs when the SQL query is invalid or not allowed.

          **Common causes:**
          - Using non-SELECT SQL statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)
          - Invalid table or column names
          - Syntax errors in SQL query
          - Query exceeds character limit
          - Too many JOIN operations
        invalid_signature: >-
          This error occurs when the signature provided for the given user
          operation is invalid.


          **Steps to resolve:**

          1. Verify the signature was generated by the correct owner account

          2. Ensure the signature corresponds to the exact user operation hash

          3. Check that the signature format matches the expected format

          4. Confirm you're using the correct network for the Smart Account


          **Common causes:**

          - Using wrong owner account to sign

          - Signing modified/incorrect user operation data

          - Malformed signature encoding

          - Network mismatch between signature and broadcast
        malformed_transaction: >-
          This error occurs when the transaction data provided is not properly
          formatted or is invalid.


          **Steps to resolve:**

          1. Verify transaction encoding:
             - **EVM networks**: Check RLP encoding is correct
             - **Solana**: Validate base64 encoding
          2. Ensure all required transaction fields are present

          3. Validate transaction parameters are within acceptable ranges

          4. Check that the transaction type is supported on the target network
          (see our [Supported
          Networks](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/get-started/supported-networks)
          page for more details)


          **Common causes:**

          - Invalid hex encoding for EVM transactions

          - Missing required transaction fields

          - Incorrect parameter formats

          - Unsupported transaction types

          - Network-specific transaction format mismatches
        not_found: >-
          This error occurs when the resource specified in your request doesn't
          exist or you don't have access to it.


          **Steps to resolve:**

          1. Verify the resource ID/address/account exists

          2. Check your permissions to access the resource

          3. Ensure you're using the correct network/environment

          4. Confirm the resource hasn't been deleted


          **Common causes:**

          - Mistyped addresses

          - Accessing resources from the wrong CDP project

          - Resource was deleted or hasn't been created yet
        payment_method_required: >-
          This error occurs when a payment method is required to complete the
          requested operation but none is configured or available.


          **Steps to resolve:**

          1. Add a valid payment method to your account using the [CDP
          Portal](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com)

          2. Ensure your payment method is valid and not expired


          **Common causes:**

          - No payment method configured on the account

          - Payment method is expired
        rate_limit_exceeded: |-
          This error occurs when you've exceeded the API rate limits.

          **Steps to resolve:**
          1. Implement exponential backoff
          2. Cache responses where possible
          3. Wait for rate limit window to reset

          **Best practices:**
          ```typescript lines wrap
          async function withRetry(fn: () => Promise<any>) {
            let delay = 1000;
            while (true) {
              try {
                return await fn();
              } catch (e) {
                if (e.errorType === "rate_limit_exceeded") {
                  await sleep(delay);
                  delay *= 2;
                  continue;
                }
                throw e;
              }
            }
          }
          ```
        request_canceled: >-
          This error occurs when the client cancels an in-progress request
          before it completes.


          **Steps to resolve:**

          1. Check client-side timeout configurations

          2. Review request cancellation logic in your code

          3. Consider increasing timeout thresholds for long-running operations

          4. Implement request tracking to identify premature cancellations


          **Best practices:**

          ```typescript lines wrap

          async function withTimeout<T>(promise: Promise<T>, timeoutMs: number):
          Promise<T> {
            const timeout = new Promise((_, reject) => {
              setTimeout(() => {
                reject(new Error("Operation timed out"));
              }, timeoutMs);
            });

            try {
              return await Promise.race([promise, timeout]);
            } catch (error) {
              // Handle timeout or cancellation
              throw error;
            }
          }

          ```
        service_unavailable: >-
          This error occurs when the CDP API is temporarily unable to handle
          requests due to maintenance or high load.


          **Steps to resolve:**

          1. Retry your request after a short delay

          2. If persistent, contact CDP support with:
             - The timestamp of the error
             - Request details
          3. Consider implementing retry logic with an exponential backoff


          **Note:** These errors are automatically logged and monitored by CDP.
        timed_out: >-
          This error occurs when a request exceeds the maximum allowed
          processing time.


          **Steps to resolve:**

          1. Break down large requests into smaller chunks (if applicable)

          2. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

          3. Use streaming endpoints for large data sets


          **Example retry implementation:**

          ```typescript lines wrap

          async function withRetryAndTimeout<T>(
            operation: () => Promise<T>,
            maxRetries = 3,
            timeout = 30000,
          ): Promise<T> {
            let attempts = 0;
            while (attempts < maxRetries) {
              try {
                return await Promise.race([
                  operation(),
                  new Promise((_, reject) =>
                    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Timeout")), timeout)
                  ),
                ]);
              } catch (error) {
                attempts++;
                if (attempts === maxRetries) throw error;
                // Exponential backoff
                await new Promise(resolve =>
                  setTimeout(resolve, Math.pow(2, attempts) * 1000)
                );
              }
            }
            throw new Error("Max retries exceeded");
          }

          ```
        unauthorized: |-
          This error occurs when authentication fails.

          **Steps to resolve:**
          1. Verify your CDP API credentials:
             - Check that your API key is valid
             - Check that your Wallet Secret is properly configured
          2. Validate JWT token:
             - Not expired
             - Properly signed
             - Contains required claims
          3. Check request headers:
             - Authorization header present
             - X-Wallet-Auth header included when required

          **Security note:** Never share your Wallet Secret or API keys.
        policy_in_use: >-
          This error occurs when trying to delete a Policy that is currently in
          use by at least one project or account.


          **Steps to resolve:**

          1. Update project or accounts to remove references to the Policy in
          question.

          2. Retry your delete request.
        network_not_tradable: >-
          This error occurs when the selected asset cannot be purchased on the
          selected network in the user's location.


          **Steps to resolve:**

          1. Verify the asset is tradable on the selected network

          2. Check the user's location to ensure it is allowed to purchase the
          asset on the selected network


          **Common causes:**

          - Users in NY are not allowed to purchase USDC on any network other
          than Ethereum
        guest_permission_denied: >-
          This error occurs when the user is not allowed to complete onramp
          transactions as a guest.


          **Steps to resolve:**
