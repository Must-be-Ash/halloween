              The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable
              for different programming environments, including REST APIs and
              RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each
              `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error
              message, and error details. You can find out more about this error
              model and how to work with it in the [API Design
              Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
